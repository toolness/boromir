This is a text-based re-enactment of Boromir's death scene from The Fellowship of the Ring.

The simulation uses [Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition][] rules.

I originally implemented it in Python in 2003. In 2011, I ported it to HTML5.

The HTML5 version uses the [Application Cache][] to enable offline use, and has been tested on IE8, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and iOS.
